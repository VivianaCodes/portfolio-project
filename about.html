            <p class="mb-5 about-me">
              I was always passionate about languages and during the high school
              I learned English, German and French. I graduated at the
              University of La Sapienza Rome in Marketing and Communication.
              After the university life took me in Germany, where I was able to
              excercise and improve my german and to find an office job. During
              my years at Samhammer AG, I learned a lot about customers and
              technologies. I was part of a team that was taking cares of the
              technical side of an SAP based application. It was very
              challenging to learn somethin new in a different language, but i
              managed to become a Key user and teach my coworkers, complete the
              QS for my team each month and assist my Team Leader with User
              guides, OPIs etc... After some years now, I feel like this job
              gave me everything that it could and I felt like at a dead point.
              It is then, that I found out about SheCodes and thought out lou:
              "No way I am going to be able to code something! This something
              for Engineers!". With all my skeptims I joined the free class,
              then the basic, and the plus...It was amazing to see how much i
              learned and the infinite possibilities this world can give. And
              that's when I decided I loved it and wanted to be my job.
